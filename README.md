End-to-End LLM-Powered Q&A System with LangChain, OpenAI, and MySQL

This project is an end-to-end Question & Answer application built using LangChain and the OpenAI API, with a Streamlit-based user interface.

Users can ask natural language questions about wardrobe inventory, and the system will:

    Convert the question into an SQL query using an LLM.

    Execute the query on a MySQL database.

    Retrieve the relevant results.

    Present the answer in a clear, user-friendly interface.

It combines modern LLM capabilities with database integration, enabling intuitive, conversational access to structured data.
